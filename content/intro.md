#Vision Statement

The following ramblings are in response to a question put to me during an interview I had for the role of Solution Architect at a prestigious law firm in the city of 
london. The question was to around what my vision is for a technical roadmap and what would be the first things I would do in the during the first few months of my new
 role if I was the successful candidate.
   
##The Droids are Taking Over the World!!

##The Computer Revolution

Ok, droids maybe not quite taking over the world, but they are certainly taking our jobs...

Over the last few years we have seen tools demonstrate abilities that we have never seen before.  Such services are now taken for granted. Take for example the 
translation services that are available to us today.  Once upon a time, using translation services required human intervention who are subject matter experts in a 
particular language, but we are now seeing translations services being accessible for everyone to use via devices such as the desktop all the way down to smart phones.  
If we now take a look at what is available to us compare to what we had a few years ago, we have:
 
 - real-time translation via Skype,
 - just-in-time translation via ###,
 - augmented translation via apps that run on Google Glass, iPhone and Android such as World Lens,
 - and wearable technology that translate sign language into words.

Technologies such as Siri and Google Speak allow us to control our devices by voice to do execute specific tasks.  Technologies such as Microsoft Kinect are allowing 
humans to interact with computers, TV's and other devices by using gestures, either for recreational pleasure or to improve the life of people with disabilities. 

This was unthinkable several years ago but we are using this tech more and more on a day-to-day basis.  Granted that while the above technologies are not perfect, 
they are only going to get better! Moore's Law would suggest that they are going to be twice as powerful in the next two years, sixteen times better in six years.  

We are also now seeing computers moving away from being task driven to become generalists.  IBM's super computer, Watson, 
has appeared on general knowledge game shows in the US and it has
beaten human competitors hands down.  Imagine a technology such as Siri being integrated with Watson.

We are also seeing algorithm's and artificial intelligence being used to automate the creation of reports and articles where it is hard to distinguish whether it has 
been produced by a human or machine.

Big data is helping institutions to predict human behaviour; from our shopping habits all the way to how we react to a natural disaster or predict industry trends.  Big 
data and artificial intelligence is also playing a big part of machine learning, allowing data to be used to assist common-sense reasoning and making machines smarter.

We are have also seen a change in the drivers of innovation.  Innovation was typically driven my men in suits that have come from commercial and academic institutions 
who come up with brilliant ideas. But the internet, together with the open source movement, has allowed software and hardware to be more accessible and we are now 
seeing a rise in innovation from sources where we don't really care who is coming up with the idea or what their background is or where they come from. Open source is 
growing fast, regardless of whether institutions are happy or not.  Technologies such ad 3D printing and services such as Crowdsourcing is also enabling innovation 
allowing groups of individuals to convert their ideas to reality.

The way in which we are being educated is also changing fast.  It is now common place to get IT related training delivered the internet and less via classrooms. Devices 
such as tablets are becoming the common place in schools. And we are now seeing the model of higher education change dramatically.  Those who want to achieve academic 
qualifications, but have been unable due to geographical or financial boundaries, are finding that tuition is becoming more and more accessible.  University of the People 
(http://uopeople.edu/) is the first *accredited* virtual university to offer high quality tuition at the fraction of the cost.  As the founder quoted "A new era is 
coming, an era that will witness the disruption of the higher education model as we know it today, from being a privilege for the few to becoming a basic right, 
affordable and accessible for all."

Wearable technologies will make a bigger impact than what the introduction of smartphones did.

##The Future

The computer revolution as described above will have a profound effect on services offered by professional organisations.  Organisations such as Allen & Overy must make
 investments today to protect them for the future, as described above.  This will force us to rethink 
 customer engagement and loyalty strategies.  Artificial Intellegence will offer ways to automate mundane tasks conducted by fee earners and support staff, 
 or offer more possibilities in the realm of document automation or automate tasks around due diligence.
 
 
 
Using Big Data strategies with historical data will give Allen & Overy an insight into how the company has evolved.  Understanding your past may help you better 
understand your future.
